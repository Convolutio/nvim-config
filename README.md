# 👨‍💻 nvim-config
Here is a repository to host my Neovim setups.
For each setup, a branch is developed according to the usage context (e.g. whether some IDE layer such as [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) is attached). Please read the configuration specifications in the branch that you are interested in.
