# üåõ LunarVim config

## üìÅ Where to move this configuration

```sh
~/.config/lvim
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes about the layer installation

At this time, LunarVim launching does not work for the snap version of Neovim, unless if the
replacement below is carried out:
```sh
# replace the line below...
exec -a $NVIM_APPNAME nvim -u "$LUNARVIM_BASE_DIR/init.lua" "$@"
# ...by the following one:
exec \nvim -u "$LUNARVIM_BASE_DIR/init.lua" "$@"
```

We recall that lvim can be called by default for launching nvim or write git commits. Just write the
following lines in `~/.bashrc` or equivalent shell configuration file:
```sh
alias nvim=lvim
export EDITOR=lvim
```
